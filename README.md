# My sample React application - my-react-context

To understand/practice React concepts: Context

- Technical points: define and use Context ( context/data are stored at top or higher level, children components down at different levels of DOM tree access or manipulate the context ). 
- There are 2 context defined:
    - ThemeContext - string, its value can be toggled.
    - UsersContext - stores data of users, more users can be fetched.
